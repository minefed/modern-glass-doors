Tired of normal boring doors without glass in them? Well look no further, glass doors aims to spice up your world with more modern looking doors.

Simply combine a normal door with a glass pane in a crafting table, or right click an existing door holding a pane to create a glass variant.

## FAQ for developers and the like
If you wish to compile a previous version of Modern Glass Doors, please clone the repo using the appropriate tag from your desired version.

Build with JDK 17 using `./gradlew build` (`gradlew.bat build` on Windows).
Both `build` and `remapJar` automatically run data generation before packaging the
block states, models, recipes, loot tables, and tags. Generated files live under
`build/generated/resources` and are removed by `clean`.
`./gradlew verifyRuntimeResources` checks the remapped JAR for all 24 doors and
trapdoors and their model/texture references; this check also runs during `build`.
